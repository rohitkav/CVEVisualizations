# CVE Visualizations


CVE Visualizations is a project made to show trends of CVE's for top open source projects/vendors over time. 
Using OpenCVE's tool to periodically import a list of the most updated CVE's in real time, one can access all the 
stored CVE information and data and create accurate graphs with the most updated data.
